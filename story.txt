Adam wakes up in the morning.
He brushes his teeth.
He takes a bath.
He has breakfast.
Then he checked Instagram.
He goes to class.
The lecturer was very boring.
He was confused with git.
He couldn't figure out the exercise.
He stressed out.
He was crying.
He decided to work hard.
It worked out.
    All he had to do was just work hard.
    And he got what he wants.

So in life, we must always work hard
    No matter what.

If we don't
    We will regret it one day.

As the saying goes, better late than never.
